== Functional documentation

=== How to authenticate the requests?

The endpoints of the middleware are secured by HTTP basic authentication.
You have to use the *ID of the tenant* and the corresponding *access token* to authenticate.

image::documentation/tenant_log_entry.png[logentry]

[IMPORTANT]
.Default tenant generation on startup
====
During the first startup of the middleware, a default tenant is generated and printed on level INFO within the log file.
You have to store the credentials at a safe place to authenticate again.
====

=== External credentials for the actuator endpoints

If you do not want to use the generated credentials for the actuator endpoints, you can define your own credentials.
You need to activate the profile `actuator-credentials` and set the following environment variables:

|===
|Name |Description
|`ACTUATOR_TENANT_ID` | The ID of the tenant to use for the actuator endpoints.
|`ACTUATOR_TENANT_TOKEN` | The access token of the tenant to use for the actuator endpoints.
|===

=== How to integrate the middleware in your project?

If you have a running instance, the integration is quite easy.
The following diagram shows the main aspects of the integration process in your personal application.

image::documentation/integration.png[integration]

==== Set up an instance of the middleware

There are two possible options when setting up an instance of the middleware.
The first one is to set up the whole environment by yourself.
The second one would be to have a look at a commercial offer, like the https://www.lmis.de/connectivity-service-for-agrirouter/["Connectivity Service for agrirouter©"]
which is based on the middleware and provides multiple packages for different needs.

==== Configuration of the callbacks and the certificates within the agrirouter©

If you do not have an agrirouter© account, please follow the instructions to register a developer account and create your application within the agrirouter© to proceed with the integration.
If you already have an application, you can start with the configuration of the application.

First thing to do is the configuration of the callback within the agrirouter©.

image::documentation/configure_callback.png[callback]

The callback endpoint is part of the middleware and has to be reachable as redirect target for the onboard process.

After you configure the callback, you need to generate the certificates.
Both certificates, the public and the private one are needed for the next steps.
So please save them to a keystore, a notepad or something else.

==== Register an application within the middleware

After finishing the configuration within the agrirouter© you are ready to set up your application within the middleware.
There is a dedicated endpoint to register a new application, please see the Swagger documentation of the middleware to have all the details.

==== Define the capabilities of the application

Each application version has its own capabilities, and therefore, they have to be configured during the setup process.
An example could be:

[source,json]
----
{
    "supportedTechnicalMessageTypes": [
        {
            "direction": "SEND",
            "technicalMessageType": "ISO_11783_TASKDATA_ZIP"
        },
        {
            "direction": "SEND",
            "technicalMessageType": "SHP_SHAPE_ZIP"
        }
    ]
}
----

In this case, the application would be able to send ISO11783 task data and shape files.
If you need more details, please see the Swagger documentation.

Regarding the capabilities, the middleware is able to handle the following technical message (content message types):

|===

==== Define the mandatory router device

Since router devices are mandatory to use the middleware to connect to the agrirouter©, you have to add at least one router device to your application.
You can create a router device using your developer account within the agrirouter©.
At first you have to navigate to the "Router Devices" section.

image::documentation/router_devices/navigate_to_router_device_management.png[router devices]

Afterward, you are able to create a new router device.

image::documentation/router_devices/create_new_router_device.png[create router device]

The router device will be created, and you can see the details of the device.
You are now able to download the connection details of the router device.

image::documentation/router_devices/download_connection_details.png[download connection details]

By clicking the button, a new window will open, and you can download the connection details as a JSON.

image::documentation/router_devices/connection_details.png[connection details]

You can either use a PEM or a P12 certificate for the connection to the agrirouter©.
The middleware is able to handle both of them.

image::documentation/router_devices/select_certificate.png[certificate]

After downloading the connection details, you can add the router device to your application within the middleware.
Use the corresponding endpoint and provide the connection details as JSON.
You can use the whole content of the JSON file which you downloaded from the agrirouter© and provide it as the body of the request.

==== Onboard process for new endpoints

The middleware provides endpoints for the onboard process for farming software and telemetry platforms; communication units are not supported since they are not in the main scope of server side software.
The endpoints for the onboard process will redirect the user to the agrirouter© interface.
If you do not define a redirect URL when calling the endpoint, then the redirect will be to a page within the agrirouter middleware.
Otherwise, the priority for redirect urls is as follows:

1. `redirectUrl` parameter within the call of the endpoint
2. `redirectUrl` within the settings of the application (see Swagger documentation for more details)
3. Default redirect page within the middleware

After you created you own endpoint with your chosen `externalEndpointId`, the `externalEndpointId` is everything you need to send data and fetch messages from the agrirouter©.

=== Profiles

There are three main profiles, the `dev` profile, the `qa` profile and the `prod` profile.
The profiles define which log level is set or which job intervals are configured.
You can activate those profiles via https://www.baeldung.com/spring-profiles[Spring Boot configuration] on the command line or via environment variable.

In addition, there are two profiles that activate the maintenance mode to access additional REST endpoints = this is the  `maintenance` profile - or enable the access to the PROD environment of the agrirouter© - the profile `connect-agrirouter-prod`.
Those profiles can be set in addition to the main profiles.

1. `-Dspring.profiles.active=dev` — Running the middleware in DEV mode with access to the QA environment of the agrirouter©.
2. `-Dspring.profiles.active=qa` — Running the middleware in QA mode with access to the QA environment of the agrirouter©.
3. `-Dspring.profiles.active=prod` — Running the middleware in PROD mode with access to the QA environment of the agrirouter©.
4. `-Dspring.profiles.active=maintenance` — Running the middleware in QA and in maintenance mode with access to the QA environment of the agrirouter©.
5. `-Dspring.profiles.active=connect-agrirouter-qa` — This mode injects a QA environment with specific URLs for the agrirouter©.
6. `-Dspring.profiles.active=connect-agrirouter-prod` — This mode injects a production environment with specific URLs for the agrirouter©.

=== Logging for Business operations

Each changing business operation is logged with the log level "TRACE".
The log contains the following information:

* ID of the endpoint (`externalEndpointId` [eid] and `agriroputerEndpointId` [aid]).
* ID of the application (`internalApplicationId` [iid] `applicationId` [aid]).
* Log a message for the business operation.

==== Trace of business operations

There is an aspect for business operations that logs with the log level "TRACE".
The log contains the following information:

* Name of the method that is called.
* Parameters and parameter values of the method.
* Execution time of the method.

==== Request correlation with X-Correlation-ID

The middleware supports request tracing using the `X-Correlation-ID` HTTP header for tracking requests across distributed systems.

===== How it works

* If an `X-Correlation-ID` header is provided with an HTTP request, the middleware will use this ID for all log statements related to that request.
* If no `X-Correlation-ID` header is provided, the middleware automatically generates a new UUID-based correlation ID.
* The correlation ID is included in all log statements using the MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context), appearing in the log output as `[correlationId]`.
* For async responses, the correlation ID is returned in the response headers using the same `X-Correlation-ID` header name.

===== Usage example

To track a request across multiple systems, include the `X-Correlation-ID` header in your HTTP request:

[source,http]
----
POST /secured/api/application HTTP/1.1
Host: middleware.example.com
Authorization: Basic dGVzdDp0ZXN0
X-Correlation-ID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
Content-Type: application/json
----

The same correlation ID will appear in all log statements for this request and will be returned in the response headers.

===== Log format

The correlation ID appears in the log output in cyan color between square brackets. Example:

[source]
----
2025-11-20T13:45:39.123+00:00 INFO  [http-nio-8080-exec-1] [550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000] d.a.m.controller.ApplicationController : Processing application registration
----

If no correlation ID is provided, it will be shown as `--`:

[source]
----
2025-11-20T13:45:39.123+00:00 INFO  [http-nio-8080-exec-1] [--] d.a.m.controller.ApplicationController : Processing application registration
----

=== Scheduled jobs

There are several scheduled jobs that are executed in the background.
The following jobs are running:

* The middleware checks the connection of each endpoint to the agrirouter© in a configurable intervall.
* The middleware fetches messages from the agrirouter© and confirms them in a configurable intervall.
* The middleware is sending out the cached messages in a configurable intervall.
* If the agrirouter© is not responding, the middleware is caching the messages waiting for ACKs and removes them in a configurable intervall.
* The recipients of the endpoints are queried in a configurable intervall.
* The middleware logs the status of the endpoints in a configurable intervall.

=== Branding the UI with a custom CSS

You can brand the built-in pages (landing page, onboarding result page, and error page) by adding your own stylesheet that is loaded in addition to the default styles.

==== Configuration

The external stylesheet URL/path is read from the Spring property `app.branding.customCss`.

You can set it in `application.yml`:

[source,yaml]
----
app:
  branding:
    customCss: "/css/custom-theme.css"
----

Or via environment variable:

[source,shell]
----
APP_BRANDING_CUSTOMCSS=/css/custom-theme.css
----

Supported values:

- A path that is served by the application itself, e.g. `/css/custom-theme.css`.
- Place your file at `src/main/resources/static/css/custom-theme.css` so it is available under `/css/custom-theme.css` at runtime.
- A full absolute URL to a CDN or external host, e.g. `https://cdn.example.com/app/custom.css`.

Behavior when unset: If the property is not defined or empty, the additional stylesheet is not included and the UI looks unchanged.

==== Where the CSS is injected

The stylesheet is conditionally included by both layout fragments so all pages that use these layouts will load your CSS:

- `agrirouter-middleware-application/src/main/resources/templates/fragments/layout.html`
- `agrirouter-middleware-application/src/main/resources/templates/fragments/layout-without-menu.html`

Snippet inside both fragments:

[source,html]
----
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
      th:href="${@environment.getProperty('app.branding.customCss')}"
      th:if="${@environment.getProperty('app.branding.customCss')}"/>
----

Pages using these layouts include (among others):

- Landing page: `agrirouter-middleware-application/src/main/resources/templates/landing_page.html` (uses `layout-without-menu`)
- Onboard process result page: `agrirouter-middleware-application/src/main/resources/templates/onboard-process-result.html` (uses `layout-without-menu`)
- Error page: `agrirouter-middleware-application/src/main/resources/templates/error.html` (uses `layout`)

==== Styling hooks per page (examples)

All pages share utility classes to make targeting straightforward.
Each page adds a page-specific modifier class you can use in your custom CSS.

- Shared across all pages:
- Container: `.page`
- Grid: `.page-grid`

- Landing page (`landing_page.html`):
- Page root: `.page--landing`
- Grid container: `.page-grid--landing`

  Example:

  [source,css]
  ----
  /* Overall page look */
  .page.page--landing {
    background: #0f172a;        /* slate-900 */
    color: #e2e8f0;             /* slate-200 */
    min-height: 100vh;
  }

  /* Center content a bit tighter on large screens */
  .page-grid.page-grid--landing {
    max-width: 720px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
  ----

- Onboard process result (`onboard-process-result.html`):
- Page root: `.page--onboard-result`
- Grid container: `.page-grid--onboard-result`

  Example:

  [source,css]
  ----
  .page.page--onboard-result {
    background: #f8fafc; /* subtle light background */
    padding-top: 5vh;
  }

  /* Optional: colorize the material icon for success/failure states */
  .page--onboard-result .material-icons {
    font-size: 72px;
  }
  .page--onboard-result .material-icons.success { color: #15803d; } /* if you add such a class */
  .page--onboard-result .material-icons.error   { color: #b91c1c; }
  ----

- Error page (`error.html`):
- Page root: `.page--error`

  Example:

  [source,css]
  ----
  .page.page--error {
    background: #fff1f2; /* light red tint */
    color: #881337;      /* dark red text */
    min-height: 100vh;
  }

  .page--error .error-logo {
    width: 160px;
    opacity: 0.9;
  }
  ----

==== Minimal complete example stylesheet

Create `src/main/resources/static/css/custom-theme.css` with the following content and configure `app.branding.customCss: "/css/custom-theme.css"`:

[source,css]
----
/* Shared */
.page { font-family: Inter, system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, sans-serif; }
.page-grid { padding: 24px; }

/* Landing */
.page--landing { background: linear-gradient(180deg, #0ea5e9 0%, #22c55e 100%); color: #0b1220; }
.page-grid--landing { max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; }

/* Onboard result */
.page--onboard-result { background: #f8fafc; }
.page-grid--onboard-result { max-width: 640px; margin: 0 auto; }

/* Error */
.page--error { background: #fff1f2; color: #7f1d1d; }
----

[TIP]
.Cache busting
====
When serving the file from your app, you can append a version query to force clients to refresh after updates, e.g. `/css/custom-theme.css?v=2025-11-12`.
====

[TIP]
.Troubleshooting
====
- Ensure the file is reachable in the browser under the configured path.
- Verify that your page indeed uses one of the two layout fragments; otherwise the CSS will not be injected.
- If you host the CSS on a different domain, make sure it is accessible over HTTPS and not blocked by your CSP settings.
- If actuator endpoints are enabled, you can verify the effective value via `/actuator/env` searching for `app.branding.customCss`.
- If your overrides don't seem to apply, increase selector specificity or use more targeted selectors; the custom CSS loads after MDL and `application.css`, so it should take precedence without `!important`.
====

[NOTE]
.Content Security Policy (CSP) for External Custom CSS
====
When using an external URL or CDN for `app.branding.customCss`, your browser may block the stylesheet due to Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions. To allow your custom CSS to load, you must configure your CSP header to permit styles from the external domain.

**How to configure CSP `style-src` directive:**

Add the domain hosting your custom CSS to the `style-src` directive in your CSP header. For example, if your CSS is hosted at `https://cdn.example.com`, your CSP header should include:

----
Content-Security-Policy: style-src 'self' https://cdn.example.com;
----

**Example configurations:**

- *Self-hosted CSS:*
  ----
  Content-Security-Policy: style-src 'self';
  ----
- *CDN-hosted CSS:*
  ----
  Content-Security-Policy: style-src 'self' https://cdn.example.com;
  ----

**Security best practices:**

- Only allow trusted domains in `style-src`.
- Avoid using wildcards (e.g., `*`) or `'unsafe-inline'` unless absolutely necessary.
- Prefer HTTPS for all external resources.
- Regularly review and update your CSP settings to minimize risk.

For more information, see the [MDN CSP documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/style-src).

    |404 |In case the requested resource was not found.
    |500 |In case of an internal server error.
    |503 |In case the middleware is not ready to handle requests, i.e. the agrirouter© is not available or the middleware is not connected to the database.
|===

=== Using the API for telemetry data

If your application version supports message type _ISO_11783_TASKDATA_ZIP_ or _ISO_11783_DEVICE_DESCRIPTION_ *and* _ISO_11783_TIME_LOG_, you are able to receive machine date.

For requesting telemetry data like machine data (message type _ISO_11783_TASKDATA_ZIP_ or _ISO_11783_TIME_LOG_) you first need to get the ID of the endpoint (`externalEndpointId`).
You can find this information e.g., when using `secured/api/application/+{internalApplicationId}+/endpoints`.

==== Machines

With `secured/api/telemetry-data/search/machines` you can query which machines are known by the endpoint, identified by the ID of the endpoint (`externalEndpointId`). You can filter for specific machines (by `internalDeviceIds`) and you can decide if you want to see the latest known device description of this machine (by `withCurrentDeviceDescription`). The provided `internalDeviceId` of the machine shall be used for subsequent requests.

Once your agrirouter endpoint received and processed a message of type _ISO_11783_TASKDATA_ZIP_ or _ISO_11783_DEVICE_DESCRIPTION_ you should be able to see this machine in the response of a machine request.

==== Time Periods

With `secured/api/telemetry-data/search/time-periods` you can query for which time periods machine data is available, identified by the ID of the endpoint (`externalEndpointId`). You can filter for specific machines (by `internalDeviceIds`), remove empty entries from response (by `filterEmptyEntries`) and time period you are interested in (by `sendFrom` and `sendTo` as Unix timestamps). The response contains a list of devices/machines with a list of time periods for which machine data is available. To request machine data for a specific time log period, you shall use the provided `teamSetContextId` and the timestamps `begin` and `end`.

==== Time Logs

With `secured/api/telemetry-data/search/time-logs` you can query the machine data for a specific machine (by `internalDeviceId`). You also need to provide the `teamSetContextId` given in the previous time periods request. The timestamps `sendFrom` and `sendTo` need to be within the time log period of the previous time periods request. With `ddisToList` you can define the list of DDIs you are interested in. If you do not provide a list, the value defined in `app.subscriptions.ddi.range.start` and `app.subscriptions.ddi.range.end` are used. Which specific machine data is identified by which DDI number can be looked up on https://www.isobus.net/isobus/dDEntity[isobus.net]. The response contains a list of time logs with a list of time elements. Those time elements contain information to time and GPS position of the collected machine data. The machine data itself can be found within the list of data log values, identified by the DDI number.

The endpoint `secured/api/telemetry-data/search/time-logs` provides additional information like messageId, sender and receiver of the time log message. Endpoint `secured/api/telemetry-data/search/time-logs/raw` does not provide this information.
