== How to authenticate the requests?

The endpoints of the middleware are secured by HTTP basic authentication. You have to use the *ID of the tenant* and the corresponding *access token* to authenticate.

[IMPORTANT] 
.Default tenant generation on startup
==== 
During the first startup of the middleware, a default tenant is generated and printed on level INFO within the log file. 
You have to store the credentials at a safe place to authenticate again.

== How to integrate the middleware in your project?

If you have a running instance, the integration is quite easy.
The following diagram shows the main aspects of the integration process in your personal application.

image::documentation/integration.png[integration]

=== Set up an instance of the middleware

There are two possible options when setting up an instance of the middleware.
The first one is to set up the whole environment by yourself and the second one would be to have a look at a commercial offer, like the https://www.lmis.de/connectivity-service-for-agrirouter/["Connectivity Service for agrirouter©"], which is based on the middleware and provides multiple packages for different needs.

=== Configuration of the callbacks and the certificates within the agrirouter©

If you do not have an agrirouter© account, please follow the instructions to register a developer account and create your application within the agrirouter© to proceed with the integration.
If you already have an application, you can start with the configuration of the application.

First thing to do is the configuration of the callback within the agrirouter©.

image::documentation/configure_callback.png[callback]

The callback endpoint is part of the middleware and has to be reachable as redirect target for the onboard process.

After you configured the callback, you need to generate the certificates.
Both certificates, the public and the private one are needed for the next steps.
So please save them to a keystore, a notepad or something else.

=== Register an application within the middleware

After finishing the configuration within the agrirotuer© you are ready to setup your application within the middleware.
There is a dedicated endpoint to register a new application, please see the Swagger documentation of the middleware to have all the details.

=== Define the capabilities of the application

Each application version has its own capabilities and therefore, they have to be configured during the setup process.
An example could be:

[source,json]
----
{
    "supportedTechnicalMessageTypes": [
        {
            "direction": "SEND",
            "technicalMessageType": "ISO_11783_TASKDATA_ZIP"
        },
        {
            "direction": "SEND",
            "technicalMessageType": "SHP_SHAPE_ZIP"
        }
    ]
}
----

In this case the application would be able to send ISO11783 task data and shape files.
If you need more details, please see the Swagger documentation.

=== Onboard process for new endpoints

The middleware provides endpoints for the onboard process for farming software and telemetry platforms, communication units are not supported, since they are not in the main scope of server side software.
The endpoints for the onboard process will redirect the user to the agrirouter© interface.
If you do not define a redirect URL when calling the endpoint, then the redirect will be to a page within the agrirouter middleware.
Otherwise, the priority for redirect urls is as follows:

1. `redirectUrl` parameter within the call of the endpoint
2. `redirectUrl` within the settings of the application (see Swagger documentation for more details)
3. Default redirect page within the middleware

After you created you own endpoint with your chosen `externalEndpointId`, the `externalEndpointId` is everything you need to send data and fetch messages from the agrirouter©.

== Profiles

There are three main profiles, the `dev` profile, the `qa` profile and the `prod` profile. The profiles define which log level is set or which job intervals are configured.You can activate those profiles via https://www.baeldung.com/spring-profiles[Spring Boot configuration] on the command line or via environment variable. 

In addition there are two profiles which activate the maintenance mode to access additional REST endpoints = this is the  `maintenance` profile - or 
enable the access to the PROD environment of the agrirouter© - the profile `connect-agrirouter-prod`. Those profiles can be set in addtion to the main profiles. 

=== DEV

`-Dspring.profiles.active=dev`

Running the middleware in DEV mode with access to the QA environment of the agrirouter©.

=== QA

`-Dspring.profiles.active=qa`

Running the middleware in QA mode with access to the QA environment of the agrirouter©.

=== PROD

`-Dspring.profiles.active=prod`

Running the middleware in PROD mode with access to the QA environment of the agrirouter©.

=== Maintenance

`-Dspring.profiles.active=qa,maintenance`

Running the middleware in QA and in maintenance mode with access to the QA environment of the agrirouter©.

=== agrirouter© PROD environment access

`-Dspring.profiles.active=qa,maintenance,connect-agrirouter-prod`

Running the middleware in QA and in maintenance mode with access to the QA environment of the agrirouter©. This mode injects a production environment with spefic URLs for the agrirouter©.
