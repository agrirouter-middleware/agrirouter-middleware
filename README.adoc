== The Project

image::agrirouter-middleware-logo.png[agrirouter-middleware,175,role=left]

The agrirouter© middleware was developed to have easier access to the functionality of the agrirouter.
The agrirouter© middleware is an additional layer of abstraction and provides access to the agrirouter© without deep knowledge of the underlying processes.
The agrirouter© middleware manages the connections and fetches messages from the agrirouter, based on the technical messages types registered.
In addition, the agrirouter© middleware provides simple data conversion from ISOXML TaskData to EFDI Telemetry Data and provides searching operations for DDIs and other parts of the specification.

== Why Should You Use It?

=== TL;DR ===

The agrirouter© middleware is a reliable and stable solution for your agrirouter© connection.
The middleware is OEM certified and there are no additional costs for the certification process.
Using the middleware to connect to the agrirouter© will speed up the whole process and you can focus on your business logic.

=== And The Long Version? ===

The agrirouter© middleware is OEM certified, what does this mean?
By using the agrirouter© middleware you are ready to speed up the whole process, since all the certification requirements are already fulfilled by the middleware.
This means that you can focus on your business logic and don't need to care about the certification process.
The agrirouter© middleware is a reliable and stable solution for your agrirouter© connection.

What does the OEM certification mean?
It means, that at first, there are *no additional costs for the certification process*.
The agrirouter© middleware is already certified and can be used without any additional costs.
The certification process is part of the middleware and will be maintained by the https://lmis.de[LMIS AG].
We, as the developers check the agrirouter© specification and update the middleware if there are any changes and provide the updates to the users.

In addition, you do not have to worry about the time the certification takes.
All the communication will be between you and the developers of the middleware.
You just need to send us a quick note, and we will take care of the rest.
Reach out by sending an email to mailto:agrirouter-certification@lmis.de[agrirouter-certification@lmis.de], and we will get back to you as soon as possible.

During the integration of the middleware into your solution we will have a look at your integration, since this is part of the OEM certification rules.
We check if the integration is done correctly and if there are any issues, we will help you to solve them.

=== How Could You Host It? ===

https://lmis.de[LMIS AG] is providing a free QA environment for the agrirouter© middleware.
This environment is used for testing and integration purposes.
Feel free to create an issue in the repository and we will provide you with the necessary information to access the QA environment.

There is also an option to use the services of the https://lmis.de[LMIS AG] to host the middleware.
The middleware is hosted in a cloud environment with defined SLAs, so you can be sure that the middleware is available and running.
If you are interested in hosting the middleware, feel free contact our sales team by sending an email to mailto:sales@lmis.de[sales@lmis.de].

== The Partners

The project would not have been possible without strong partners for the idea and the development.
The following companies have taken an active part during the development of the agrirouter© middleware.

image::partners/krone.png[krone,175,role="left]

The initial idea for the agrirouter© middleware has been developed by the https://landmaschinen.krone.de/[Maschinenfabrik Bernard Krone GmbH & Co. KG].
The main concept is based on the idea to make the agrirouter© connection easier for third party app providers.

The https://www.holmer-maschinenbau.com/[Holmer Maschinenbau GmBH] joined the project after the development started and added the use case of sending machine data using the agrirouter© middleware.
The agrirouter© middleware is part of the communication concept between their machines and the agrirouter© on the other side.

image::partners/lmis.svg[lmis,175,role="left]

The https://lmis.de[LMIS AG] is part of the agrirouter© universe since the beginning of the project and was chosen as implementation partner for the middleware.
Using an agile development process the middleware was developed in 2021/2022 and will be maintained as long as the project is active.

Without the https://my-agrirouter.com[agrirouter] there would not have been such a project.
The easy way to connect machines, farming software and telemetry platforms is one essential step to a strong network of agricultural machines.

== How Does It Work?

The agrirouter© middleware is an abstraction to the well-known interface of the https://my-agrirouter.com[agrirouter].
The agrirouter© middleware uses the interface of the agrirouter© and provides an easy way to manage applications and endpoints, send and receive messages or handle the connection to the agrirouter.

image::system-overview.svg[agrirouter© middleware overview]

The agrirouter© middleware provides a REST interface for endpoint management, sending messages and retrieving messages.
On the other hand the connection to the agrirouter© is based on the faster MQTT protocol to have live telemetry data with real push notifications.
The messages from the agrirouter© are fetched, confirmed and stored within an internal database.
There is no need to implement the business process on your own.
